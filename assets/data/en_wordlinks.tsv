God commanded circumcision for all Israelite men or baby boys as a signal that they were loyal to God's Old Covenant. In the New Testament, physical circumcision is no longer required to make known relationship or loyalty to God. Rather, it is used in a figurative way to explain how Christ has cut away the believer's fleshly (sinful) nature to give a new, righteous nature (Col. 2:11-13; Rom. 4:11; 1 Cor 7:18).  Also, baptism is now the sign of our loyalty to God's New Covenant.			modified by CB 2024

In ancient times, before there was a king in Israel, there were judges  who ruled over the tribes. These judges had authority to settle disputes and arguments, and even to lead soldiers in battle. Some well-known judges in the Old Testament were Eli, Samuel, Samson, Jephthah, Gideon and Deborah. In modern times, a judge is usually the one to make or announce a final decision in a court.	king, prophet	other language: man (who) decides (solution for) disputes/talk (urt)	GC 07-Feb-19 mod by CB 2024	rev by JB 4/24

A just person obeys laws. A just judge decides cases by what the law says. God is just when he rewards or punishes others by what his own laws say. God accepts as righteous or justified, those who believe his promises, as Abraham did. Although our good works show that we have faith, it is our faith that justifies or saves us. (God does not justify those who try to earn their salvation.)	righteous, good, evil

t	king	kings, King	ruler/authority person; Chief (G); king (R); 	A king is the highest ruler over a kingdom or nation.  The first king over Israel was Saul. Between Israel and Judah there were a total of 42 kings and one queen. Some nations worshipped their king as a god.

t	Kingdom of God	Kingdom of Heaven, God's Kingdom, God's King	realm of God; How God rules [reigns] over everything; God's ruling of people (G); government of God (R); 	“Kingdom of God” often means that God rules over all creation. Sometimes it refers to a future time when God’s Messiah will rule over all nations. Meanwhile, for Christians it means living in obedience to Jesus.  “Kingdom of Heaven” is the same, but uses the word Heaven in place of God, because Jews often did not want to say ‘God’ because they respected God’s Name.			RR: #3 definition seems to contradict #1.  If Jesus (and God) are truly all-powerful and have all authority, then it seems to me that Jesus has been and is currently the king over earth and heaven.  He is the High King.  Currently there are many "under kings" reigning on earth, but they are under Jesus' sovereignty.  Perhaps #3 should say something more like One day Jesus will do away with all other earthly kings and he himself will reign soley, visibly as King of earth when earth and heaven are once again rejoined/renewed. GC: God's eternal sovereign rule over his creation and its creatures, to my knowledge, is not called 'Kingdom of God' in Scripture, only in abstract theology. Theology can inform translators, but should not introduce extraneious infomation into translation of specific verses. RR: I feel more comfortable in having information that is general here, rather than trying to define past, present, future and eternal kingdoms (which is more a theological extraction than clearly deliniated in Scripture).

t	Lamb of God	God's Lamb	adolescent man sheep of God (K); young/small sheep of God (R, W)	In the time of the Old and New Testament, the Jews sacrificed lambs as a payment for their sins. John the Baptist called Jesus the Lamb of God, because he knew that Jesus would die as a sacrifice, so that God would forgive us humans of our sins. The Book of Revelation refers to Jesus as the Lamb that was slain or killed but has come back to life.			As essential element of the Good News is that Jesus was crucified because of our sins. Romans explains that Jesus' death exonorates God who forgives guilty sinners. However, the idea of substitution seems a modern, evangelical metaphone that displaces attention away from the holiness of God onto a kind of punishment theme, perhaps a useful idea though hard to prove scripturally.	mod by CB 2024

In Israel, only the Levites were allowed to serve as priests and workers in the temple at Jerusalem. Both Moses and Aaron were Levites. Jesus came from the tribe of Judah so he was not a Levite, but after he died and ascended to heaven, he became the high priest for his followers because he reconciles us to God.

Although the Romans brought good laws to every place, they levied heavy taxes and required everyone to honour their gods. The Romans believed that their kings, which they called "caesar", were divine gods.  The Jews especially hated the Romans, and the Romans eventually destroyed Israel. Rome built many roads and kept countries from warring against each other.  This allowed the Good News about Jesus to spread very rapidly for 300 years.

t	Sabbath		rest; cease work; Day of Sabat (K);	Sabbath is a Hebrew word meaning rest or cease from work. After creating the world, God (and later the Law of Moses) decreed the seventh day of each week to be a Sabbath day uniquely for rest, not for doing any normal or hard work. Feasts and festivals were also Sabbath days. In Jesus time, the Jews had added many more rules against activity on Sabbath days. Jesus angered the Jewish leaders because he sometimes broke those rules. Israelites offered three kinds of sacrifices: 1) Purification sacrifices. Since human beings pollute their community with everything that comes from their body, they had to offer bloody sacrifices to purify Yahweh's tabernacle (tent), so that he could continue to dwell amongst them. 2) Worship sacrifices. Just as people must pay taxes and tribute to chiefs and kings, so humans had to offer up burnt sacrifices to honour Yahweh, along with their prayers and petitions on behalf of their community and of themselves. 3) Thanksgiving sacrifices. Both the community and individuals offered sacrifices in thanks and praise to Yahweh who had provided all that they needed, or after he had answered their prayers. However, there was no sacrifice to remove the guilt of personal sins and crimes. Much later, Jesus would offer himself as a sacrifice, when he was crucified, so that God forgives the sins of those who repent and trust in Jesus. (Adapted from Lexham Bible Dictionary.) 	rest				
t	sacrifice	sacrifices, sacrificed	offer of a slaughtered animal; giving your life or goods to another (G);gift that is habitually cooked (R); 	A sacrifice is any costly thing that someone would give, kill or burn to please or honour a god or gods.

Jehovah God instructed the Israelites to offer certain kinds of animals or produce to cover the disobedience or evil that they had done. When Jesus Christ died, he gave his life so that the sins of people who had faith in him would be forgiven. Christians today offer worship, praise, thanks and their own bodies as a living sacrifice to God.  				rev by JB 4/24
